# Patentify
## Android app for managing patent applications efficiently 

This project is developed for the Intellectual Property cell of my college. The IP cell handles the patent applications filed by the students and faculty and keeps track of the applications through all the stages from filing till grant of patent. 

This application computerizes the management of the patent applications and provides an easy way to add, update and view the records. This project intends to save time by reducing the heavy manual work, which is otherwise involved in maintaining the application records. The application also intends to send timely notifications to the admin, reminding him/her to fill the required forms and to check application status during the patent filing process.

At present this work is done manually by the IP cell head, which involves a lot of paperwork and consumes enormous time. It is also prone to errors, data redundancy or time delay. To overcome all these issues we have developed the patent application manager app.
